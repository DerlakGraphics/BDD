        <p>     Beginning the 12th Generation F-150, Ford gave the previous generation an entire body makeover. A different front end was created, as well as a longer crew cab with more spacious rear seats. The 2009-2010 were only avaliable with the Triton Modular V8. There was the 2-valve 4.6L single overhead cam V8 paired with the 4L60E 4 speed transmission. There was also the higher output 3-valve 4.6L dual overhead cam V8 paired with the 6R80 6 speed transmission. The largest was the 4-valve 5.4L dual overhead cam V8 paired with the 6R80 6 speed transmission. In 2010, in the Raptor trim, the 2 valve 6.2L dual overhead cam V8 was introduced and produced an astonishing 411 horsepower. Introduced for the first time in 2009 was the Platinum trim which is a high end luxury package that adds heated and cooled seats as well as a 8.5 inch touchscreen radio head unit with navigation.

        <p>     In 2011, Ford decided it was time to ditch the Triton engine lineup in the F-150 due to the design being 20 years old by that point. To replace those, Ford introduced the 5.0L dual overhead cam Coyote V8. Ford's other engine would lead to one of the biggest advancements to fuel economy: the 3.5L twin turbo V6 Ecoboost. With 2 less cylinders, owners were able to get higher fuel mileage as well as the nice power from the turbo boost. One more engine was introduced to replace the 2-valve 4.6L, the 3.7L naturally aspirated V6. This engine was used in fleet trucks and low trims. One other major feature of the 2011-2014 is the electronic assisted power steering and the hill desent control on the FX4 trim and Raptor. In 2013, Ford introduced the HIID headlights on higher trims which used gas activated HIID Headlight Bulbs. The 6.2L V8 was offered in other trim levels than the Raptor as well
