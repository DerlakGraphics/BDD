            <h3>About The Diverging Diamond Interchange</h3>
            <p>The diverging diamond interchange is a more advanced version of the diamond interchange. The non freeway road crosses lanes to get the turning lane closer to the exit ramp. The two crossroads on each end have turn signals that allow each end to go one at a time.</p>
